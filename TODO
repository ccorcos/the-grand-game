some random functions:
randomly choose from discrete distribution with weights

win and causalities (calculate cost)

army = number of supplied and unsupplied units
battle modifiers: cards and terrain

how does a battle work?
win-lose:
    add total defensive strength of defending army (including modifiers)
    add total attacking strength of attacking army (including modifiers)
    discrete roll

casualties:
    all simultaneus kills

    each unit does a 50% roll to possibly kill twice (after everyone has attacked once. if this unit dies, he kill again)
    remembers that offense and defense have different kill scores (out of 6)
    sum up kills for each army
    randomly choose n kills based on a weighted discrete distribution

CODE:

-- list of unit types -> form for numbers. defense, offense, supplied and unsupplied.
-- discrete random functions, weighted stuffs
win lose + casualties


battle modifiers cards and terrin - later

SAM:
layout
['infantry', 'armor', 'light fleet', 'heavy fleet', 'aircraft']
autoform with simple-schema


DO:
casualties
iron router - layout, navbar, loading spinner + delay, form and results pages 

outcome
OFFENSE WINS
defense casualties
infantry:2
armor:2
etc.
offense causalties
